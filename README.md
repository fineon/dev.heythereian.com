hey there! thought i would document what i'm working on :) this is my portfolio site on dev.heythereian.com

## Here's what I learned after BrainStation bootcamp and on my own:
- ```Scrum/Agile Development``` in teams. We worked together on a website managing inventories for a warehouse company. Each members of the team handled tickets distributed from Jira, a ticketing system by Atlassian. We assess production time by assessing the scope of the work/ticket and assign them a number on a scale of 5, from easiest to hardest feature to implement.
- ```SCSS``` - CSS pre-processor. Styling with CSS is now much more advanced with variables, nested selectors, mixins, extension and interpolation. I am now deeply committed to advocating for SCSS in any new projects because styling is so much fun with SCSS.
- ```React.js``` - the pioneer Javascript framework for Single Page App infrastructure (SPA). SPA is significantly faster than traditional HTML and vanilla JS since everything is loaded at the start. React also lets me insert dynamic data and process them with logic flow to display the view I want to users. 
- ```Express.js``` - the popular Node.js backend server. I learned to use Express.js to process data in the back-end and serve them to front-end. It is also very useful for handling CORS issue that hinders a lot of development work flow on the front-end.
- ```REST APIs``` - working with REST API is such a pleasure when it delivers the exact data I need to process and display on a React app. It is an incredible tool that other websites/companies are opening up to developers, which helps me access another data platform for my websites.
